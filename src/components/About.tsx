                <p>
                    Currently studying Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. I'm passionate about learning and applying software 
                    engineering concepts to real projects.

                    I enjoy experimenting with modern tools while building applications that balance functionality with creativity,
                     and I look forward to contributing to projects that make a real impact.
